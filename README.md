## üîç Project Overview

The Smart Workplace Allocation Platform (SWAP) is an intelligent tool designed for the automated and flexible assignment of workspaces in dynamic environments, such as training centers or flexible offices. Developed for mid-sized IT service providers with multiple offices and a dedicated training facility, SWAP addresses the challenges of high-demand, fluctuating occupancy, and the need for team-based seating arrangements.

The platform automates the complex task of workspace assignment, ensuring an optimal and fair distribution of resources. It is particularly useful in environments with a high turnover of personnel, like students and interns, and where fixed seating arrangements aren't feasible.

-----

## üéØ Objectives

The main goal of SWAP is to provide an automated solution for workspace allocation that:

  * Integrates **individual attendance schedules** and **seating preferences**.
  * Performs an **automatic seating calculation**.
  * Considers **user priorities** (e.g., permanent employees \> students \> interns).
  * Maximizes overall user satisfaction by fulfilling as many requests as possible.
  * Dynamically reacts to data changes.
  * Places members of the same project team together in the same room whenever possible.
  * Considers room availability and amenities.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Mathematical Model

The core of SWAP's functionality is an **optimization problem** aimed at maximizing a **satisfaction function `U`**. This function represents the overall satisfaction of all users, subject to various constraints:

  * Room capacities.
  * Attendance times.
  * Seating conflicts and preferences.
  * Priorities of user groups.

This problem is modeled as a non-linear program and can be solved using methods like the **Simplex algorithm** or **heuristic approaches** for greater complexity.

### Input Data

The system's planning algorithm uses the following data for each participant:

  * **Period of Presence**: Start and end dates.
  * **Regular Days**: The specific weekdays a person is present.
  * **Planned Absences**: Vacations, business trips, or sick leave.
  * **Individual Preferences**: Preferred rooms or specific workspaces.
  * **(Future Feature)**: Desired neighbors or people to avoid.

-----

## ‚ú® Key Features & Benefits

  * **Flexibility**: The platform adapts dynamically to new users, schedules, and constraints.
  * **Automation**: It eliminates the need for manual planning, saving significant time.
  * **Fairness**: Decisions are automated, fair, and transparent, taking into account user priorities and preferences.
  * **Scalability**: Works efficiently for both small and large teams (10 to 1000+ participants).
  * **Interactive Visualization**: Provides a visual and interactive seating chart that can be viewed daily.

## üìù User Guide

### 1\. Starting the Application

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. This will load the initial interface for planning the training center.

### 2\. Room and Workspace Planning

Draw the schematic layout of the training center by creating **rooms** and **workspaces** as rectangles. Each room and workspace must have a unique ID.

### 3\. Switching to Planning Mode

Click the "**Demonstration**" button to enter the planning mode.

### 4\. Entering Schedules and Preferences

Each participant enters their attendance details, including their period of presence, regular weekdays, planned absences, and preferred rooms or workspaces.

### 5\. Automatic Calculation and Results

The system automatically calculates the optimal seating plan and visualizes it. You can view the daily plan and navigate through a calendar to see changes over time.

-----

## üìä Results & Visualization

  * **Interactive Plan View**: An overview that shows who is sitting where (room & seat) on a daily basis.
  * **Calendar View**: Allows navigation through weeks and months.
  * **Flexible Expansion**: The platform is designed to be expandable for real-world environments.

-----

## ‚úÖ Current Status

The project is a **functional prototype**. The core logic is implemented and has been validated with test data. The application's behavior is flexible and logical.
